# Technical Interview Prep

The following repo contains core concepts and problems (with solutions). Many of the examples come from **[Competitive Programmer’s Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)**. And for system design I will be following the MIT course, **[Distributed Systems](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-WkMbsvGQk9_UB)**.


**Objectives:**

To review algorithm concepts (Greedy, Dynamic Programming and Amortized Analysis,...). To review system design concepts and compile examples. 

**Intended Audience**
* Student/Programmer who wants to refresh their knowledege for technical interview
* Newer to Computer Science: Use *-sol.pynp* as a guide and read *Competatives Programmers Handbook*
